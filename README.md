# ModCraft
**Agent for Minecraft Mod Creation**  
Turn ideas into fully playable Minecraft mods using natural language.

> “From prompt → playable mod” — without requiring a full engineering background. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## What we’re building
ModCraft is an agentic system that helps creators turn *natural-language mod ideas* into *working Minecraft mods*—fast, iterative, and safer to modify over time. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### Why this matters
Minecraft has a massive modded player base, but mod development still has a steep learning curve:
- Engineering/tooling overhead (e.g., Java / Gradle / mod loaders)
- Design & asset pipelines (e.g., Blockbench / pixel art)
- “Low-code” tools still feel hard for non-dev creators :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## How ModCraft is different
Traditional “prompt → code” generation is often one-shot, hard to debug, and risky to iterate.  
ModCraft uses a **Spec-first workflow** with a structured intermediate representation and executable tasks:

**Prompt → LLM → Spec → LLM → IR → Task → Execution** :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Key advantages
- **Spec as the single source of truth** (human-readable, persisted, versioned) :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Explainable & auditable** generation pipeline :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Rollback support** for safer iteration :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **Delta-based updates**: make targeted changes without regenerating everything :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## What ModCraft aims to support
We want creators to go beyond simple code generation and support a full creation loop:
- No-coding requirement (creator-first)
- Auto compile & runnable outputs
- AI mod generation + detailed modification
- Modpack generation :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}


## Publishing & community
We plan to meet creators where they already are:
- Platform marketing: CurseForge / Modrinth
- Auto-publish mods generated by ModCraft with **#MadeByModCraft**
- Social: Reddit / YouTube / X (Twitter)
- Community: Discord / Telegram
- Launch channels: HackerNews / ProductHunt :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}


## Example: Spec-first workflow (concept)
Below is a **conceptual** example of what a human-readable “Spec” could look like:

```yaml
name: "Glowstone Lanterns"
target: "Minecraft Java Edition"
mod_loader: "Fabric/Forge"
features:
  - add_block:
      id: "modcraft:glow_lantern"
      behavior: "emits_light"
      crafting: "iron_nugget + glowstone_dust"
  - add_item:
      id: "modcraft:lantern_handle"
notes:
  - "Keep textures vanilla-friendly"
```

The key idea: **you can update this spec and ask the agent to apply a delta**, instead of rewriting everything.

## Contributing

We’re early-stage and moving fast—PRs, issues, and design discussions are welcome.

* Start by opening an Issue with:

  * your mod idea (in natural language),
  * expected behavior,
  * target MC version/mod loader if you have preferences.

TBD (will be added per-repo).
Until then, treat code/assets as “all rights reserved” unless a repo states otherwise.
